# Personal Trainer Client Tracker

Deployed at: 

## Client Sessions

For each day of the month, enter the number of completed sessions in the corresponding box. A running total is shown at the top for easy access. At the end of the dates, there will be a "store for the month" button that will store the final result in the corresponding month at the bottom of the page, as well as a "reset counter" button that will reset the dates. The "reset counter" button will be disabled until the result is stored.

## Client Tracker

There will be an ability to track how many consecutive sessions each client has completed. There is one input that will take in the client name. When the client name is submitted, it will populate below, with an "increase sessions" button, a "decrease sessions" button (in case of error), as well as a "reset sessions" button in case a client misses a session.

## Technology:

### Storage

Information is stored in state, and will be sent/retrieved from local storage. There is the ability to set up with a database if client is requesting to use multiple devices to access information.
